        "Welcome to the Wisconsin Dales — where the only thing wetter than the jokes is the weather.",
        "It’s like the Wisconsin Dells, but legally distinct and emotionally identical.",
        "Our slides are imaginary, but the puns are real slippery.",
        "Come for the Dales. Stay because you misread the sign.",
        "We put the ‘Dell’ in ‘Well… that was a joke.’",
        "No water parks, just splash damage from laughter.",
        "If you’re not having fun, you might be in the wrong Dales.",

        "You wanted the Dells. You got the Dales. Close enough for a Midwestern goodbye.",
        "All thrills, no spills… unless you spill your drink laughing.",
        "We’re on a pun-limited aquifer. Please recycle your groans.",
        "This site contains 0% water and 100% dad approval.",
        "The Dells zigged. The Dales zagged. Nobody knows why.",
        "Please keep your arms, legs, and expectations inside the joke at all times.",
        "Welcome to the Wisconsin Dales — the only attraction where the main splash is sarcasm.",
        "It’s like the Dells, but with no people and more emotional support drinks.",
        "Our lazy river is just you standing around thinking about snacks.",
        "No water rides, but plenty of dry humor.",
        "Wisconsin Dales: come for the name, stay because you already parked.",
        "The slides are imaginary, but the dad jokes are very real.",
        "We proudly operate on a strict no-refunds-for-eye-rolling policy.",
        "If found fun, please return to the Wisconsin Dales immediately.",
        "Our wave pool is just someone saying “woooosh” nearby.",
        "This is what happens when the Dells takes a wrong turn and leans into it.",
        "Zero chlorine. 100% WTF.",
        "Wisconsin Dales — legally distinct, spiritually identical.",
        "We’re not saying it’s better than the Dells… but we’re also not not saying that.",
        "Come ride our most popular attraction: mild amusement.",
        "Our gift shop is just compliments and bad advice.",
        "You can’t spell ‘Dales’ without ‘Deals’… actually you can, but still.",
        "We’re a splash of fun and a puddle of responsibility.",
        "If excitement lasts more than four hours, please tell everyone.",
        "The only thing deeper than our water is our commitment to puns.",
        "Wisconsin Dales: where expectations are managed very carefully.",
        "Our admission price is one polite nod and a chuckle.",

        "This attraction may cause uncontrollable sighing and smiling.",
        "We don’t have a height requirements, but emotional immaturity greatly helps.",
        "Our rides are imaginary, which makes the lines move really fast.",
        "The Midwest goodbye starts here and never truly ends.",
        "If you’re confused, you’re still doing it right, keep going.",
        "Welcome! You are now officially ‘having a good enough time.’",
